## MyReads Project

This project is providing a platform for book lovers where they have a dashboard to keep the books. The dashboard is divided into three different shelves as mentioned below:

* Currently Reading
* Want To Read
* Read

The user can find any book that they like and keep it for themselves on the dashboard. There is also a search bar where the user can find any book and can select that book and it will be also available on the dashboard.

## Steps to Install and Run the application

* Install the project dependency with `npm install`
* Start the server using `npm start`

## Main Page

* You can move the book between shelves using a button on the left bottom (aka Shelf Changer) of the book.
* You can also remove the book from the shelves by selecting "none" in the shelf changer button.

## Search Page

  You can type in any `Genre` of the book on to the search bar and the book will appear on the screen. You can select any book using Shelf Changer button and can keep it on the shelves.
